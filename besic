 interaction over a network

How does data exchange between applications take place?


tip
SoaP and Rest are not really comparable
Rest defines an architectural approach
Whereas Soap poses restrictions on the format of xml which is exchanged between your service provider and the service consumer

Soap stands for Simple Object Access Protocol
Important thing is soap defines a specific xml request and structure
if you're using soap then you have to use this structure.
you have to create soap envelope which contains a soap header and a soap body.
the header contains meta information like authentication, authorization, signatures and thinks like that.
body is where you really put the real content of your request or your response.
* soap XML REQUEST and soap XML RESPONSE.
* Transport soap over MQ or soap over HTTP
* service definition WSDL stands for web service definition language

xsd -> stands for -> xml schema definition



tip
Rest sands for REpresentational state transfer
which is coined by ROY FIELDING if you remember, ROY FIELDING is the guy who also developed HTTP PROTOCOL.
make best use of http
http methods (get, put, post..)
http status (200, 404)

http stands for -> hyper text transfer protocol

url stands for -> uniform Resource identifier
a resource can have different representations -> xml, html, json

Rest
* Data exchange format
    No Restriction.json is popular
* Transport
    Only http
* Service Definition
    No Standard.WADL/swagger/..
